/**
 * Interface to represent a basic filesystem, in which files can be
 * listed, read, deleted or moved to a folder.
 * <p>
 * For Basic filesystems, filenames could be more or less globally unique IDs. In such a case:
 * - moving or copying a file to a folder might change its name
 * - moving or copying a file to a folder will never 'overwrite' a file already present in the folder
 * and therefore for basic filesystems:
 * - toFile(folder, filename) may return always the same result as toFile(filename)
 * - rollover and overwrite protection is not supported
