<h1>Introduction</h1>

The Frank!Framework offers services to integrate other software packages.
The typical end user owns many software packages that need to communicate in
a standardized way. This is done by connecting the individual software
packages to an instance of the Frank!Framework.
<p>
When some existing software package A wants to reach another existing
software package B, then A typically accesses the integration solution
instead. The integration solution receives the incoming message and
transforms it to a format that B can understand. The transformed
message is sent to B. This is a very simplified view, but it allows
us to introduce the basic building blocks offered by the Frank!Framework.
<p>
The most important building blocks are listeners, pipes, senders and receivers.
Listeners are the building blocks that accept incoming messages. Messages can
originate from HTTP requests, the file system, the database and more, which
explains that there are many types of listeners. Listeners are wrapped in
receivers that add additional services about logging and transaction
management. Pipes are used to transform messages. Each possible
transformation of a message has its own type of pipe. Finally, senders
write messages to the database, send them as HTTP requests, write
them to files or send them elsewhere. Each of these possibilities
has its own type of sender.
<p>
Integration solutions are typically developed by Frank developers, who
decide how the building blocks have to be combined and configured.
Frank developers provide this information through XML files and properties
files. The Frank!Framework parses these XML files into networks of
Java objects that can provide the actual integration solution. The
Frank!Framework also allows developers to work with a graphical
user interface. To understand this from a user perspective, please
read the <a href="http://frank-manual.readthedocs.io">Frank!Manual</a>.
<p>
The Frank!Framework is a Java application that provides a web interface.
It runs on an application server. WeAreFrank! supports running the
Frank!Framework on Apache Tomcat, JBoss Application Server (recently renamed to WildFly)
or WebSphere Application Server. The web interface is typically
used by operators who are responsible for the proper operation
of the integration solution, or as WeAreFrank! says: the Frank.
The Frank!Console is described in the <a href="http://frank-manual.readthedocs.io">Frank!Manual</a>.

<h1>Building blocks</h1>

The building blocks are defined by Java interfaces in the package
{@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core}. All pipes implement
interface {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.IPipe}. All
listeners implement {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.IListener}.
All receivers implement {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.IReceiver}.
And all senders implement {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.ISender}.
The implementation of {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.IReceiver}
appears in class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.receivers.GenericReceiver}.
Some implementations of {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.IListener}
also appear in that package. Many pipes are implemented in
package {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.pipes} and many
senders are implemented in {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.senders}.
