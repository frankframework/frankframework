/**
 * <p>Performs various PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) actions such as Encrypt, Sign, Decrypt, Verify.</p>
 * <p>To use this pipe action parameter has to be set to one of the actions above.</p>
 * <p>
 * <br/><strong>Encrypt:</strong>
 * <p>
 * Requires the publicKey to be set to recipients public key,
 * and recipients to be set to recipients email addresses.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <br/><strong>Sign:</strong>
 * <p>
 * On top of the requirements for <i>Encrypt</i> action,
 * signing requires senders to bet set for user's email;
 * and secretKey & secretPassword to be set to private key's path and it's password
 * (password is optional, if private key does not have protection).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <br/><strong>Decrypt:</strong>
 * <p>
 * Requires secretKey and secretPassword to bet set to private key's path and it's password.
 * Just like signing, password is not required, if private key does not have protection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <br/><strong>Verify:</strong>
 * <p>
 * On top of the requirements for <i>Decrypt</i> action,
 * verification expects list of senders' email's and corresponding public keys.
 * However, sender emails does not have to be set, and in that case,
 * this pipe will only validate that someone signed the input.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <br/>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> When secret key is required in any of the actions,
 * the related public key should also be included in public keys.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> For fields that require multiple input
 * (such as recipients, senders and publicKey -in certain actions-)
 * you can seperate multiple values with ";" (semicolon).
