/**
 * Interface to be implemented when a class has one or more special default
 * values (i.e. a default value of attribute X depends on the value of attribute
 * Y). When a class implements this interface the getSpecialDefaultValue method
 * will be called for every attribute used in the Ibis configuration when it is
 * being loaded and checked for default values (warning "already has a default
 * value"). At this time the set methods and the configure method aren't called
 * yet but the values specified in the Ibis configuration are known. To make use
 * of these values this interface should be implemented.
 * 
 * Please note that the normal get method of the attribute should return an
 * object or when it returns a primitive should not return a null value. I.e.
 * when the return type is boolean but a Boolean null value is returned a
 * NullPointerException (wrapped in an InvocationTargetException) will be thrown
 * and written to the logfile as a warning by the code checking for default
 * values because reflection is being used to call the get method. From the
 * javadoc of java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler: If the value returned by this
 * method is null and the interface method's return type is primitive, then a
 * NullPointerException will be thrown.
