/**
 * A semaphore is a flag used to check whether a resource is currently being 
 * used by another thread or process and wait for the other process to release it.
 * <p>For example, if a process wants to use the printer,
 * it first needs to make sure the printer is available by checking to see if the semaphore
 * has been set. If it is set, it needs to wait to the process that currently has it is finished. however, 
 * If the printer were free, the process would set the semaphore and start using the printer, blocking 
 * access to all other processes until it finished. <p>
 * <p>Semphores are a classical technique for protecting critical sections of code from being
 * simultaneously executed by more than one thread. A semaphore is a generalisation of a monitor.
 * A monitor allows only one thread to lock an object at once. A semaphore allows N processes. </p> 
 * <p>The process of grabbing a semaphore for semi-exclusive use is called downing the semaphore because they are 
 * implemented with a countdown integer that decrements for each lock and increments for each unlock.
 * If a semaphore is fully occupied, new threads wanting to use it will wait until some thread releases its l
 * ock by upping the semaphore. For a semaphore to work, the check for full, and the decrement must be done 
 * all in one atomic uninterruptible instruction. This is done by the {@link #release()} method.</p>
