/**
 * Class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChild} specifies what Frank elements
 * can be contained in another Frank element. The present class {@code ConfigChildSetterDescriptor}
 * contains some of the information that has to be put in {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChild}.
 * The present helper class holds the information that comes from the file {@code digester-rules.xml}.
 * 
 * Why don't we create {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChild} directly without
 * creating this helper class? As an example, consider a digester rule that links setter
 * {@code setAbc()} to a syntax 1 name {@code abc}.
 * This rule is represented by an instance of {@code ConfigChildSetterDescriptor}. If there are
 * two classes {@code X} and {@code Y} with method {@code setAbc()}, then two
 * different instances of {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChild} are needed. The reason is that
 * {@code X.setAbc()} and {@code Y.setAbc()} can have a different {@code sequenceInConfig}.
 * That field is obtained from an {@code IbisDoc} annotation.
