/**
 * This package contains a set of model classes that is used by {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.DocWriterNew} to generate the
 * XML configuration schema used by Frank developers. Please note that {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.DocWriterNew} is
 * presently not used; this class is under development.
 * 
 * <h1>The model</h1>
 *
 * The following diagram introduces the Java classes of the model:
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/FrankDocModel.jpg" width="600" alt="Image FrankDocModel.jpg can not be shown" />
 * <p>
 * Class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} models a Java class of the Frank!Framework that can be accessed from a
 * Frank config. An example is {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} <code>nl.nn.adapterframework.parameters.Parameter</code>,
 * which you can reference in a Frank config with the tag <code>&lt;Param&gt;</code>. The modeled Java class
 * can have a superclass, which is expressed by the link named "parent".
 * <p>
 * A tag in a Frank config can contain other tags. A <code>&lt;Receiver&gt;</code> can
 * for example contain <code>&lt;DirectQuerySender&gt;</code> or
 * <code>DirectQueryErrorSender</code>. These two tags reference the same Java class, namely
 * {@code nl.nn.adapterframework.jdbc.DirectQuerySender}, but the first tag uses
 * it as a Sender while the second tag uses it as an ErrorSender. The model expresses a set
 * of allowed child tags by relating a containing {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} to an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}.
 * An {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} has a property <code>roleName</code> to express the role and references
 * an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} to define what child {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} objects can appear. Each
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} has one or more {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} objects as members.
 * <p>
 * There are two
 * flavors of {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} objects. Some {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} objects model a Java
 * interface. In this case, the members are the {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} objects that model
 * the Java classes that implement the Java interface. Please note that not every Java interface
 * that appears in the Java source code is modeled by an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} object. An
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} object appears only for Java interfaces that are relevant for nesting
 * tags in a Frank config. Some {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} objects model Java interfaces that have
 * an inheritance relation. This inheritance is expressed in the model using the "highest common interface"
 * relation. This relation is needed for some corner cases of generating the XML schema file.
 * <p>
 * Other {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} objects
 * just model a single Java class, which is expressed by a reference to the corresponding
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} as the only member.
 * <p>
 * There is no direct relation between {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}, because the
 * relation between a parent tag and a child tag requires some additional information.
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.DocWriterNew} requires information on how often a child tag can appear, whether
 * usage of the child tag is deprecated, and some other information. This additional information
 * is included in class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChild}, which also references the {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} of
 * the parent tag and the {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} for a set of allowed child tags.
 * <p>
 * Tags in Frank configs can have attributes, which are modeled by class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankAttribute}.
 * Attributes can have their values restricted by a Java enum type. In that case, the list of allowed values is stored in a
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.AttributeValues}, which can be shared by multiple {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankAttribute}. 
 * The tag in which the attribute occurs is modeled by its {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}, see relation
 * "attribute of". The documentation of an attribute may appear in a Java class that differs
 * from the attribute owning Java class (the IbisDocRef Java annotation). This is expressed
 * by the relation "described by".
 * <p>
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} only hold the attributes and config children that are
 * declared by the modeled Java class. Attributes or config children owned by inheritance are not modeled
 * directly as children. {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} has methods to browse
 * inherited children, which need a callback object of type {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.CumulativeChildHandler}.
 * This functionality works the same for attributes and config children. Therefore,
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankAttribute} and {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChild}
 * have a common superclass {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementChild}. That class also
 * parses IbisDoc annotations, which is done the same way for config children and attributes.
 * <p>
 * The model is not only used to generate the XML Schema file (<code>ibisdoc.xsd</code>). It is also
 * used to generate a website with reference documentation. That website documents all tags
 * ({@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} objects) that can be used. The {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} objects are grouped
 * by the implemented Java interface (interface-implementing {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} objects). There
 * is an additional group "Other" for all {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} that belong to a non-interface-based
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} (e.g. {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.PipeForward}). These table-of-contents (TOC)
 * groups are modeled by model class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankDocGroup}.
 * <p>
 * Class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankDocModel} holds the entire model (not shown in the diagram). Two model classes
 * have not been explained yet: {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet} and
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}. These have been introduced to avoid conflicts
 * in the XML schema file. These conflicts are explained in the next section.
 * 
 * <h1>Conflicts</h1>
 *
 * <h2>Element names from FrankElement</h2>
 *
 * A {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} models a Java class that Frank
 * developers reference using an XML tag. Method {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement#getXsdElementName(ElementRole)}
 * calculates the name of this XML element. Remember that XML elements in Frank configs not only
 * express the referenced Java class but also the role in which this Java class is used. This is
 * why the method has an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} argument.
 * <p>
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}-s in
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankDocGroup} "Other",
 * like <code>&lt;Forward&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Param&gt;</code>, are
 * named in a special way. They usually belong to a single
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}. Their name is
 * based on the syntax 1 name of that {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}.
 * <p>
 * This way of naming introduces potential conflicts when deprecated
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}-s are included. These potential conflicts
 * are explained in the following subsections, with the solutions applied to prevent them. There are
 * also some other potential conflicts. These are explained as well.
 * 
 * <h2>ElementRole member conflicts</h2>
 * 
 * A Pipeline can have pipes as children, which appears in the Java code as a config child setter:
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.PipeLine#addPipe(nl.nn.adapterframework.core.IPipe)}.
 * The resulting config child has an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}
 * that we can express as (IPipe, pipe), IPipe representing the
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementType} and "pipe" is the syntax 1 name.
 * The members of this element role include the following: 
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.pipes.FixedResult} and {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.pipes.FixedResultPipe}.
 * Method {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement#getXsdElementName(ElementRole)} gives
 * them the same name, which is <code>FixedResultPipe</code>.
 * <p>
 * To avoid this type of conflicts, element role member conflicts, we do the following for each
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}.
 * We collect all members ({@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}) and group them by
 * the XML element name that these members get for the role. When an XML element name
 * is shared by multiple {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}-s, we assume
 * that the conflict has arisen because the core team intended to rename the Java class behind
 * the element name. The old Java class is needed for backwards compatibility,
 * but it has been deprecated to support resolving the conflict. This assumption allows us
 * to omit the deprecated {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}-s. We
 * emit a warning in case the conflict remains unresolved.
 * 
 * <h2>The generic element option</h2>
 *
 * The XML schema files we produce are needed by the Frank!Framework to parse
 * configurations. To make this possible, our XML schemas need to support syntax 1, which
 * means syntax like <code>&lt;Listener className="nl.nn...."&gt;</code>.
 * This element is allowed as a child of each XML element that is allowed already
 * to contain a particular listener as child, for example as a child of <code>&lt;Receiver&gt;</code>.
 * We say that <code>&lt;Listener&gt;</code> is the generic element option of
 * <code>&lt;Receiver&gt;</code>.
 * <p>
 * Our XML schemas should specify which 
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}-s are allowed as
 * children of a generic element option. These {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}-s
 * do not have to be written out explicitly, because we can reference
 * XML schema groups that are based on {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s,
 * the member children. The member children of an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}
 * are found by collecting all config children of all members, and taking
 * the {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} of each
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChild}. The generic element
 * option is defined by adding a group reference for each relevant member child, the
 * set of relevant member children depending on the XML schema version being created.
 * <p>
 * In some cases, multiple {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s have to
 * share a generic element option. The example is
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.batch.StreamTransformerPipe}. It has
 * config children with the followin {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>(IRecordHandlerManager, child)
 * <li>(RecordHandlingFlow, child)
 * <li>(IRecordHandler, child)
 * <li>(IResultHandler, child)
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If all of these would be used to define the generic element option <code>&lt;Child&gt;</code>,
 * the XML schema would be invalid. If the parser would encounter <code>&lt;Child&gt;</code>, it
 * would not know which definition to apply.
 * <p>
 * This potential conflict is resolved by merging config children. When a
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} has cumulative
 * config children sharing a syntax 1 name, then these config children
 * are merged. This check is done by method {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement#hasOrInheritsPluralConfigChildren(java.util.function.Predicate, java.util.function.Predicate)},
 * which takes {@link java.util.function.Predicate} arguments that express
 * the XML schema version being created. Config children sharing a common
 * syntax 1 name for the XML schema version being created are called "plural config children".
 * <p>
 * To be able to handle plural config children, we introduce model entity {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet}.
 * All cumulative config children of a {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement} are grouped
 * by syntax 1 name, and each group results in a {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet}.
 * We use {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet}-s instead of {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChild}-s
 * to fill XSD element groups, resulting in common code for plural and non-plural config children.
 * 
 * <h2>Conflicts by ElementType interface inheritance</h2>
 *
 * Listeners are Frank elements that receive incoming messages. A Java class within
 * the Frank!Framework is a listener when it implements {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.IListener}.
 * There is a potential conflict because there are Java interfaces that inherit from
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.core.IListener}. There is a pipe
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.pipes.PostboxRetrieverPipe} with
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} (IPostboxListener, listener).
 * We also have {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.pipes.SenderPipe} with
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} (ICorrelatedPullingListener, listener).
 * These two pipes are members of role (IPipe, pipe). There is a generic element
 * option <code>&lt;Pipe&gt;</code> that can have an element <code>&lt;Listener&gt;</code>.
 * But if both listener {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s
 * (IPostboxListener, listener) and (ICorrelatedPullingListener, listener) would
 * be used to define the <code>&lt;Listener&gt;</code>, a conflict would result.
 * If the parser would encounter <code>&lt;Listener&gt;</code>, it would not know
 * which of the two definitions to use.
 * <p>
 * This conflict is resolved by promoting the two {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s
 * to (IListener, listener). Every {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}
 * is used only once and thus this promotion resolves the conflict. We call it the
 * "highest common interface", which is calculated by method
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole#getHighestCommonInterface()}.
 *
 * <h2>Member conflicts with element name of generic element option</h2>
 * 
 * We have an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}
 * (IErrorMessageFormatter, errorMessageFormatter) which has
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.errormessageformatters.ErrorMessageFormatter}
 * as member. Element groups including a generic element option
 * <code>&lt;ErrorMessageFormatter&gt;</code> cannot also define
 * XML element <code>&lt;ErrorMessageFormatter&gt;</code> to reference
 * Java class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.errormessageformatters.ErrorMessageFormatter}.
 * This conflict with the element name of the generic element option is found
 * by method {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole#getDefaultElementOptionConflict()}
 * by that XML element. 
 * 
 * <h2>Member conflicts in shared generic element option</h2>
 *
 * Members of a generic element options shared by plural config children can introduce a conflict.
 * An example occurs in {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.batch.AbstractRecordHandler}. It has the following
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> (InputfieldsPart, child)
 * <li> (OutputfieldsPart, child)
 * </ul>
 *
 * These are non-interface-based {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s, so these
 * would both define XML element <code>&lt;Child&gt;</code>. This is not possible. Syntax 2
 * does not provide the option to reference Java class <code>InputfieldsPart</code>
 * or <code>OutputfieldsPart</code> in role "child". This is not a big issue, because
 * they are available in roles "inputFields" and "outputFields". Furthermore, they can
 * still be expressed in syntax 1: <code>&lt;Child className="...InputfieldsPart"&gt;</code>.
 * <p>
 * The config child setters for (InputfieldsPart, child) and (OutputfieldsPart, child)
 * are deprecated. One could wonder why we do not try to resolve the conflict by
 * omitting deprecated config children. In theory, a FF! version could have
 * existed in which the config child setter for (InputfieldsPart, child) was not deprecated.
 * Then that version could define <code>&lt;Child&gt;</code> to reference
 * Java class <code>InputfieldsPart</code> in role "child". We do not want this, however,
 * because it threats backward compatibility. We would have old Frank configs including
 * <code>&lt;Child&gt;</code>, but they would be incorrect now because of the conflict.
 * <p>
 * To detect member conflicts in shared generic element options, the model has entity
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}. Each
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet} is linked to an {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}
 * that has the element roles of the config children of the {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet}
 * as members. When multiple {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet}-s reference the
 * same set of {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s, then they reference
 * a common {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet} object. Each
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} knows the {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}-s
 * it belongs to. {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} uses this information to
 * omit members that would conflict with a shared generic element option. Class
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet} is not public, because
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} takes care of calling
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}. 
 * 
 * <h2>Generic element option recursion</h2>
 *
 * This subsection describes a conflict that does not occur in version 7.6-SNAPSHOT
 * of the Frank!Framework. It is covered by the test input classes in package
 * <code>nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.testtarget.exotic</code>. There is a class
 * <code>Master</code> with {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}
 * (IMember, part). This role has no {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}-members
 * with plural config children, but there is still a conflict. All child members of this role should
 * be used to find child XML elements of <code>&lt;Master&gt;&ltPart&gt;...</code>. We have
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement}-s <code>Member1</code> and
 * <code>Member2</code> that have config children with the following {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}-s:
 * (Child1, child) and (Child2, child). These are not interface-based, but we cannot
 * define element <code>&lt;Master&gt;&ltPart&gt;&lt;Child&gt;</code> to reference
 * them both. We would have two conflicting definitions, because it is not clear whether this
 * XML element would reference to <code>Child1</code> or <code>Child2</code>.
 * <p>
 * We solve this issue by omitting syntax 2 elements for Java classes <code>Child1</code> and <code>Child2</code>.
 * These classes are only available through syntax 1: <code>&lt;Child className="..."&gt;</code>.
 * This is implemented in two places. First, we introduce more {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole}
 * objects. For each {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet}-based
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}, we introduce new
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}-s by calculating the member
 * children and grouping them by syntax 1 name. We do this recursively. The recursion
 * will stop because the recursion will find sets of element roles that correspond
 * to existing {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet} objects.
 * <p>
 * Omitting syntax 2 elements for these conflicts is also done in {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.DocWriterNew}.
 * The example shows that the contents of a generic element option does not
 * necessarily correspond to a {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet}.
 * To fill a generic element option, we need to get a {@link java.util.Set} of
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRole} holding the roles that are
 * selected for the XML version being created. Then we have to calculate member children
 * recursively from these element role sets. The model provides static method
 * {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ConfigChildSet#getMemberChildren(java.util.List, java.util.function.Predicate, java.util.function.Predicate, java.util.function.Predicate)}
 * to support this. We cannot use {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}
 * for this in {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.DocWriterNew}, because {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.DocWriterNew}
 * has to filter roles for the chosen version of the XML schema. Class {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.ElementRoleSet}
 * works without filtering role. That class has to find conflicting {@link nl.nn.adapterframework.doc.model.FrankElement},
 * the conflicts not being affected by the version of the XML schema being created.
