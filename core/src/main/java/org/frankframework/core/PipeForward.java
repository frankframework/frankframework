/**
 * Appears inside a pipe and defines what pipe or exit to execute next. When the
 * execution of a pipe is done, the pipe looks up the next pipe or exit to execute.
 * This pipe or exit is searched based on a key that describes what happened during
 * pipe execution. For example a {@link FixedResultPipe} searches for key
 * <code>filenotfound</code> if it tried to read a file that did not exist,
 * preventing it from producing the desired output message. If there was
 * no error, the {@link FixedResultPipe} searches for key <code>success</code>.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Each <code>&lt;Forward&gt;</code> tag is used to link a search key (<code>name</code> attribute)
 * to a pipe or exit to execute next (<code>path</code> attribute). The forward's <code>path</code>
 * attribute references the target pipe or exit by its <code>name</code> attribute, see
 * {@link AbstractPipe} and {@link PipeLineExit}. For most pipes and most keys, the next
 * pipe is executed if no forward is found. By default, the pipes in a pipeline are executed consecutively.
