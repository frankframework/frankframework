 * This is an integration test that ensures that the {@link NarayanaTransactionHelper} allows connections to be closed.
 * See PR #4517 - Ensure connections are closed properly when using Narayana.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * This class creates a scenario where a message with a high Delivery-Count (JMS header) is offered to the Frank!Application.
 * While attempting to read the message of the Queue and put it in an ErrorStorage, the TX timeout should kick in, resulting
 * in a message that keeps bouncing between EMS and the application.
 *
 * Don't forget to change the default transaction timeout to &lt; 30 seconds, to speed up testing.
