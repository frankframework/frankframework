-- In Oracle 12c the hidden parameter _ORACLE_SCRIPT has been introduced to allow scripts to be executed.
-- When this setting is set to true, queries are performed in the root context, opposed to a pluggable database. 
-- This avoids using C## which is discouraged by Oracle.
-- Note that this can only be used if you don't use pluggable databases!
