# Skip separate install phase as for some reason running the two default phases
# on Travis seem to cause the second phases to select the wrong profile
# (doesn't happen locally when running the exact same commands). And with maven
# it's not needed to have a separate install phase.
# Default install phase: mvn install -DskipTests=true -B
# Default script phase: mvn test -B
install: echo 'Skipping separate install phase'
script: mvn install -B -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
