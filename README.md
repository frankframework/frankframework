## Open-Source, Low-Code & Stateless
The Frank!Framework is a framework that is completely configurable through XML configurations. Each Frank!Application may contain multiple configurations, and each configuration can consist of multiple end-to-end connections which we call 'adapters'. Configurations may be (re)loaded conditionally or individiually for optimal performance and customizability.
The application may be managed and monitored through a web interface or REST API.
See it in action: https://frank2example.frankframework.org

## Rebranding
The Ibis Adapter Framework has been renamed to "Frank!Framework". The migration is a work in progress, which is why you may encounter some old(er) names throughout our source code. Don't worry, everything will remain fully backwards compatible!

## Releases
All our releases can be found on Maven central. Individual builds can be found on our Nexus repository [here](https://nexus.frankframework.org).
For more information about our releases, see our [release notes](RELEASES.md) and [releases](https://github.com/ibissource/iaf/releases).

## Security
It is important to remember that the security of your Frank! application is the result of the overall security of the hosting stack (Java, Application Server), Frank!Framework itself, all Java dependencies and your code. As such, it is your responsibility to follow a few important best practices, more information can be found in [security](SECURITY.md)
