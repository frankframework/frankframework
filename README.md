## Open-Source, Low-Code & Stateless
The framework is completely configurable through XML configurations. Each Frank!Application may contain multiple configurations, and each configuration can consist of multiple end-to-end connections which we call 'adapters'. Configurations may be (re)loaded conditionally or individiually for optimal performance and customizability.
The application may be managed and monitored through a web interface or REST API.
See it in action: https://frank2example.frankframework.org

## Rebranding
The Ibis Adapter Framework has been renamed to "Frank!Framework". The migration is a work in progress, which is why you may encounter some old(er) names throughout our source code. Don't worry, everything will remail fully backwards compatible!
