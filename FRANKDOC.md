# Frank!Doc user manual for contributors

As a contributor to the Frank!Framework, you write JavaDoc comments that are used to generate the Frank!Doc. This document explains how your comments appear in this user documentation. It also explains some Java annotations that you need to maintain the Frank!Doc.

## What is the Frank!Doc?

From a user perspective, the Frank!Doc contains of two parts. First, Frank developers use the file `FrankConfig-strict.xsd` that is generated by the frankDoc doclet (see [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md)). Frank developers typically get this file under the name `frankdoc.xsd`. They include a reference to this XML schema in the XML Frank configs they write. This gives them autocomplete functionality and tooltip help in their text editor.

The second part is a [web application](https://ibis4example.ibissource.org/iaf/frankdoc) with reference information about the XML-based language of Frank configurations. Both parts are shown here now to introduce you to the Frank!Doc.

#### XML schema for Frank developers

A Frank developer uses the XML schema when she writes a Frank config. She may start writing a config in Visual Studio Code as shown below:

![vscodeStartConfig](./picturesForContributors/vscodeStartConfig.jpg)

She types the text needed to reference the XML schema of the Frank!Doc (number 1). Then she writes the text `<A` (number 2). VSCode shows a red flag because this is invalid XML. VSCode can provide autocomplete help as shown (number 3). One of the options is the XML element `<Adapter>`. There is a button to get the tooltip help text of that element (number 4). This text is derived from the JavaDoc comment above the class declaration of [Adapter](./core/src/main/java/nl/nn/adapterframework/core/Adapter.java).

Frank developers not only see errors about invalid XML, but also about violations of the XML schema.

![vscodeXsdViolation](./picturesForContributors/vscodeXsdViolation.jpg)

The Frank developer has used an XML element `<xxx>` that does not exist. VSCode produces a red flag. The tooltip help she can get is also shown. She sees which XML elements she can use instead of `<xxx>`.

#### Web app with reference information for Frank developers

The XML schema helps Frank developers when they are writing their configs, but they also need help while designing them. They can use de Frank!Doc web application as the reference manual. It looks like shown below:

![webapp-intro](./picturesForContributors/webapp-intro.jpg)

To the top-left, you see a list of groups (number 1). These groups are controlled by Java annotation [@FrankDocGroup](./core/src/main/java/nl/nn/adapterframework/doc/FrankDocGroup.java). To the bottom-left, you see the Java class names that are members of the chosen group (number 2). When you select a class name, you get information about it (number 3). More explanation of this text follows later.
