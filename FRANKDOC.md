# Frank!Doc user manual for contributors

The Frank!Doc provides reference information for Frank developers as explained in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). It is produced by a doclet that assembles the Frank!Doc from the Java sources. You can control the Frank!Doc using custom JavaDoc tags and using Frank!Doc-related Java annotations. These annotations and tags are summarized in the table below:

| JavaDoc Tag | Java annotation | Appears on | Function |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- | -------- |
| | `@FrankDocGroup` | Class or interface | Define group as shown in top-left of webapp. Has fields `name` and `order` (integer). |
| `@ff.parameters` | | Class | Describes how parameters (Frank config `<Param>`) are used. |
| `@ff.parameter` | | Class | Describes the meaning of a specific parameter. First argument is name of parameter. Second argument is description of that parameter. |
| `@ff.forward` | | Class | Describes a forward (e.g. `success`, `failure`). First argument is name of forward. Second argument is description. |
| `@ff.tag` | | Class | Tag that classifies the Java class. First argument is tag name, second argument is tag value. |
| `@ff.default` | `@Default` | Attribute setter | Describes default value. |
| `@ff.protected` | `@Protected` | Attribute setter or child setter | Suppresses declaration and inheritance of attribute or child. Annotation is inherited. |
| `@ff.mandatory` | `@Mandatory` | Attribute or child setter | Makes attribute or child mandatory in Frank config. |
| `@ff.optional` | `@Optional` | Attribute or child setter | Undoes inherited `@ff.mandatory`, making the attribute or child optional even if it overrides a mandatory attribute or child.
| `@ff.defaultElement` | | Child setter | Set default value of `className` attribute in XSD syntax 1 element. |
| | `@EnumLabel` | Enum constant | Set representation required in Frank configs. |

**Annotation @FrankDocGroup, on interface:**  When a Java class implements an interface that has a `@FrankDocGroup` annotation, then the class is put in the group non-exclusively. A class can belong to multiple groups when it implements multiple interfaces with different groups.

**Annotation @FrankDocGroup, on class:** When a class has a `@FrankDocGroup` annotation, then the class only belongs to that group. `@FrankDocGroup` annotations on classes are inherited by descendant classes, so descendant classes are also in the specified group exclusively.

**@ff.mandatory and @Mandatory:** If you give the JavaDoc tag the value `ignoreInCompatibilityMode`, the attribute or config child will not be mandatory in `FrankConfig-compatibility.xsd`. This behavior may be useful for backward compatibility. The annotation has a Boolean field `ignoreInCompatibilityMode` that does the same.
