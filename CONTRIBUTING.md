# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us on our [community forums](https://ibissource.org/forum). We want you working on things you're excited about.


##### We use our own repository manager for snapshot builds. Either use our public `ibissource` or private `proprietary` profile when running Maven. #####


## Running the IBIS Adapter Framework

Initial:

- git clone https://github.com/ibissource/iaf
- cd iaf
- mvn
- cd example
- mvn jetty:run
- [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)


After modifying a project file:

- ctrl-c
- cd .. ; mvn clean install ; cd example ; mvn jetty:run

The jetty-maven-plugin requires Maven 3 and Java 1.8.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/ibissource/iaf/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit) and that the title is clear, obvious and informative!

Always write a clear log message for your commits. Add the current year, the name of the copyright owner and the copyright notice (when not already present) to adjusted and new files. See:

- https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html
- https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Notices.html
- https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/2367/how-do-i-properly-specify-the-years-of-copyright
- http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#apply

When relevant to the end-user first add a line to [release notes](RELEASES.md)
at the end of [section 'Upcoming'](RELEASES.md#upcoming) with a functional
description targeted to end-user. There's no limit on the length of this line.
After that create the commit message targeted to developers and Git tools with a
short one-line description in the first line (in some cases the same as the
release notes line) and if necessary a more detailed explanatory text after a
blank line. See:

- http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2290016/git-commit-messages-50-72-formatting
- http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html

One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."



## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using tabs, not spaces.
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`) and around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
  * Use Unix style newlines.
  * Each class that can be used in a configuration must contain the following documentation:
    - Class level IbisDoc, not larger then 5 to 10 lines
    - For each configurable attribute, IbisDoc must not be larger then 2 lines
    - Any examples and more detailed information, that has to be incorperated in to the IbisManual, should be provided as a separate file(s) attached to the pull request


## Testing

Before creating a pull request with your changes, please run the iaf-test module's test scenarios. If all tests pass, the chance of Ibis developers running into unexpected errors will be reduced to a minimum. Instructions on how to run the iaf-test scenarios can be found [here](TESTING_WITH_IAF-TEST.md).

We have yet to test the compatibility of the iaf-test module with Jetty. Until then, the only verified way to run the module is on a Tomcat server in Eclipse. However, feel free to try and run it on Jetty yourself! If it works for you, we'd love to hear about it. :)

### Checking differences within Larva

The iaf-test module runs Larva tests, see https://frank-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingStarted/helloLarva.html. Larva tests
execute some system-under-test, for example a Frank configuration. The
output of the system-under-test is often compared to some expected value.
The Graphical User Interface of Larva shows these differences, but sometimes
it works better to use a third-party tool like WinMerge.

If you are developing under Windows, you can do the following to set this up:

- Follow the instructions of section "Developing with Eclipse", see below.
- Download the WinMerge installer from https://winmerge.org/. After accepting cookies, you may have to refresh your browser before the download starts.
- Run the installer you downloaded. Make sure that WinMerge is added to the system path.
- Lookup the path to the WinMerge executable. You may do this by viewing the system path.
- In the Eclipse Project Explorer, you have a folder "Servers". Your Tomcat installation appears as a subfolder. Under that subfolder, open file `catalina.properties`.
- In `catalina.properties`, add: `larva.windiff.command=c:/Program Files (x86)/WinMerge/winmergeu`, but replace the value after the `=` by the path to WinMerge on your laptop.
- Start module iaf-test.
- If you see a "Differences:" panel, you have a button "windiff" above it. Please press it to see the differences in WinMerge. NOTE: You only see a "Differences:" panel if you select a low log level. Mind the pull-down menu labeled "Log level".
- If all your tests succeed, you do not have "Differences:" panels and you have no "windiff" buttons. To test your WinMerge integration, you may have to temporarily edit a test scenario to make it fail. 

## Developing with Eclipse

- Download Eclipse from [Eclipse 2019-03](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-03/r), choosing "Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers". Note that 64-bit Eclipse doesn't work with 32-bit JRE/JDK (doesn't start without any message). There is no installer. To install Eclipse, just unzip your download to a directory of your choice.
- Start Eclipse with Java 8. You might want to [use -vm in eclipse.ini](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM).
- Close Welcome.
- Make sure that the default text file line delimiter is set to Unix and default encoding is set to UTF-8: Window, Preferences, General, Workspace, New text file line delimiter: Unix, Text file encoding: UTF-8.
- Make sure Maven is able to access the internet. E.g. when behind a proxy: Window, Preferences, Maven, User Settings, settings.xml should exist and contain proxy configuration.
- Window, Open Perspective, Other..., Git, OK, Clone a Git repository, URI: https://github.com/ibissource/iaf.git, Next, Next, Finish.
- Optionally (when you have access to the proprietary jars some modules depend on) add your Nexus credentials and enable the proprietary profile in your maven settings.xml
- Return to the Java EE perspective.
- In the main menu, choose File | Import...
- The Import wizard appears which allows you to import many different kinds of projects. Open "Maven" and select "Existing Maven Projects". Click "Next".
- Browse to the directory in which you cloned the iaf Git repository. A list of `pom.xml` files appears, one for each subproject.
- **deselect**: iaf-coolgen, iaf-ibm, iaf-ifsa, iaf-sap, iaf-tibco and iaf-idin (unless you have access to the proprietary repository), Finish.
- Window, Open Perspective, Other..., Java EE.
- Rightclick iaf, Maven, Update Project..., OK. Now Eclipse will update the classpath settings according to the module pom file. (Updating the project may take a while!)
- Servers, No servers are available. Click this link to create a new server..., Apache, Tomcat v7.0 Server, Next, Browse..., select the root folder of a Tomcat installation (when not available download the latest version of [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) (version 7.0.47+ is known to work)), OK, Finish.
- Double click Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost, Open launch configuration, Arguments, VM arguments, add -Dotap.stage=LOC, OK, Modules, Add Web Module..., iaf-example, OK, File, Save
- Right click Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost, Start.
- Browse the IAF console at [http://localhost:8080/iaf-example/](http://localhost:8080/iaf-example/).

### In some cases you might want/need to:

- Rightclick iaf, Maven, Update Project..., OK.
- Delete .setting folder(s) in broken iaf module(s), followed by rightclick iaf, Maven, Update Project..., OK.
- Enable Project, Build Automatically
- Right click Tomcat Server at localhost, Clean...
- Change newlines in .classpath and org.eclipse.wst.common.component files back to Unix newlines.
- Rightclick pom.xml (in iaf), Run As, Maven build..., JRE, make sure a JDK (not a JRE) is used, Refresh, Refresh resources upon completion, Specific resources, Specify Resources..., iaf (Using "The project containing the selected resource" doesn't seem to work), Finish, Run.
- The local Maven repository might contain corrupt jar files which for example will result in java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/aspectj/lang/ProceedingJoinPoint when starting Tomcat. Remove the jar file from the repository to make Maven download the file again.
- When changing IAF versions Eclipse doesn't always automatically clean the  tomcat deploy folder (wtpwebapps). Rightclick project, Run As, Maven Clean, followed by  Right click Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost, Clean...
- Check the deployment assemblies:
  - Right-click iaf-webapp and choose Properties. In the left-hand menu select "Deployment Assembly". To the right, you see what Eclipse directories are mapped to what directories within Apache Tomcat. You should have:
    - `src/main/webapp` to `/`
    - `target/m2e-wtp/web-resources` to `/`
    - `iaf-akami` to `WEB-INF/lib/ibis-adapterframework-akami-X.Y-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    - ...
    - `iaf-larva `to `WEB-INF/lib/ibis-adapterframework-larva-X.Y-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    - `Maven Dependencies` to `WEB-INF/lib`
  - Sometimes, an additional mapping `/` to `/` is present. This is wrong; if you see it, delete it!
  - Right-click iaf-example and choose Properties. In the left-hand menu select "Deployment Assembly". To the right, you see what Eclipse directories are mapped to what directories within Apache Tomcat. You should have:
    - `/src/main/java` to `WEB-INF/classes`
    - `/src/main/resources` to `WEB-INF/classes`
    - `/src/main/webapp` to `/`
    - `/target/m2e-wtp/web-resources` to `/`
    - `iaf-core` to `WEB-INF/lib/ibis-adapterframework-core-X.Y-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    - `iaf-example` to -
    - ...
    - `iaf-webapp` to -
    - `Maven Dependencies` to `WEB-INF/lib`
  - Sometimes, an additional mapping `/` to `/` is present. This is wrong; if you see it, delete it!
- When running Tomcat v8.5, you can disable its pluggability scans to prevent unnecessarily long startup times. To do this, add the following element within the Context element of your Tomcat server's _context.xml_ file:
######
    <JarScanner>
        <JarScanFilter defaultPluggabilityScan="false" />
    </JarScanner>



## Developing with IntelliJ

- Clone this any way you like. E.g. at the commandline: git clone git@github.com:ibissource/iaf.git
- From File -> Open... Select iaf folder and import it as a Maven project.
- Make sure to select Java 7 or Java 8 as a default JDK.
- Download Tomcat 8.5 from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi and export it anywhere you like. (On windows make sure to extract it on a folder which can be edited by non-admin users.)
- On top right click "Add Configurations..." then click + button. Click "More items" on the bottom of the list and select Tomcat Server -> Local from the new list.
- Click Configure next to the Application Server and Select your Tomcat Home directory.
- Add -Dotap.stage=LOC to the VM Options
- On deployment tab click + -> artifacts... and then select ibis-adapterframework-example:war
- Name your configuration and save it
- Open Maven window by clicking Maven button on your right and open execution window by clicking "m" button. Then run command "mvn clean install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true verify"
- Run your configuration and you are ready to go.

Thanks,
