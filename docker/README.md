# Frank!Framework - Docker

This module contains Docker images for various application servers to **test** the Frank!Framework with. This is not meant for
developing Franks! nor to run in production. For that, refer to the ["Frank!Framework with Docker"](../Docker.md)
documentation.
The Docker images have been customized to run without needing much configuration.
The images contain the test configurations and secrets to connect with
our [auxiliary images](https://github.com/frankframework/ci-images) which include the databases and Messaging Systems.

This folder also contains a docker compose file to make it easy to run.

## Building test image

Use Maven to build the project and the Docker image, from the **root folder** of the project.

```shell
mvn clean package -P docker,Tomcat -DskipTests
```

## Running a test image

First make sure that you can access the auxiliary images. This can be done by:
- building them yourself, by checking out https://github.com/frankframework/ci-images/
- or by using the prebuild images in the private Docker registry `private.docker.nexus.frankframework.org`. The private repository
requires [login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/).

Use Docker compose to run any combination of test image, database and Messaging Systems. The properties will be resolved automatically.
For example, to start Tomcat with the default H2 in-memory database:

```shell
docker compose -f tomcat.yml up
```

Combine the YAML files in this folder to start a more enhanced test environment.
For example, if you want to run WildFly with MariaDB and Artemis, run this command:

```shell
docker compose -f wildfly.yml -f mariadb.yml -f artemis.yml up
```

FF!Test will be available at http://localhost/iaf-test

## Debugging inside a Docker image

It is possible to attach your Java debugger to a Docker image. You can place breakpoints but also live update classes to
work on fixes easily, without the whole Maven build and Docker compose cycle.

- First, build the test image as described above with Maven.
- Second, start the image with the following command, from the current 'docker' folder:
  ```shell
  export VERSION=8.2.0-SNAPSHOT
  docker compose -f tomcat-debug.yml up
  ```
- Third, attach to your running process, inside your IDE. In IntelliJ, choose `Remote JVM Debug` and use port 8001 at
  localhost.
- You can use breakpoints and if you update/save/compile a class inside your IDE, it is automatically updated inside
  your attached Docker image. Unfortunately, this has [limitations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/altering-the-program-s-execution-flow.html#hotswap-limitations).
- Hint: the above (optional) line with `-v` links your locally build core.jar file to the Tomcat instance. So, upon
  an image restart, you get the latest code. By performing `mvn package -pl core -am -DskipTests` in the root of your
  project, you have a new `core.jar` to use, once you restart your Docker image. This method is possible with all jar
  files used by FF!.

### Running a different version

It is possible to run the test image using a different version.
This can be done by exporting the `VERSION` property. For example:

```shell
export VERSION=8.2.0-SNAPSHOT
```

The `.env` file should contain the current version of the project, but it can be changed for a more permanent solution.

### Running Larva tests

There are two scenario root directories that can be used.

- **embedded testtool directory /opt/frank/testtool**: Uses copied tests, the image needs to be rebuild if changes are
  made.
- **external testtool directory /opt/frank/testtool-ext**: Uses mounted tests, which can be changed while the image is
  running.
